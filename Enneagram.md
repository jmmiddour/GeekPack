## RESULTS:

### What is the Enneagram?
The Enneagram is a personality system that aims to reveal how emotions drive our lives and how we engage with others in an effort to get what we want and need. The Enneagram defines **nine personality types**, each with its own set of strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for personal growth.

Your Enneagram type reveals what motivates you on a very deep level, and illuminates the path you must take to achieve a higher level of self-actualization.

### Your Enneagram Scores
The graph below shows how you scored for each of the 9 types of the Enneagram. In this graph, the area of each section indicates your score, with larger sections being a better match for your personality.

### Your Type in Depth
Your primary type is **Nine**. In this section, we'll dive deep into the Nine profile to understand how it drives your core emotions, fears, and desires, as well as how it impacts you in relationships and at work.

### In a Nutshell
Nines are defined by a desire to live in peaceful harmony with their environment. They want a sense of balance and calm, and aspire to a kind of homeostasis where nothing disturbs their inner peace. They tend to be easygoing and accepting of what is happening around them, but can become resistant and willfully oblivious when something in the environment threatens to throw them off balance.

Nines are accommodating and agreeable, and readily adjust to the people around them. Nines believe that they simply don't have strong opinions or urgent needs of their own, so they are happy to go along with what other people want and need. To others, they appear gentle, pleasant, and easy to be around.

### The 9 Types of the Enneagram
Each of the nine types of the Enneagram has its own driving force, which is centered around a particular emotion. Some types experience strong emotions, while other types aim to avoid emotions in one form or another. However, whether running from emotions or diving into them, each type describes some aspect of emotional experience.

Here, we'll look at a brief description of each of the nine types, as well as your scores for each of them.

### One = 68% MATCH

Type 1 can be thought of as The Perfectionist. Ones place a lot of emphasis on following the rules and doing things correctly.

### Five = 86% MATCH

### What Makes You Unique
Although your Enneagram type explains a great deal about you, it doesn't explain everything! In this section, we'll look at the traits that are unique to you—both those traits that can be used as super-strengths, and those which may be holding you back.

Below, you'll find information on the top 3 traits you can harness as your personal superpowers, and the top 3 traits which may be stopping you from achieving what you desire. One important thing to remember is that personality traits are never all good, or all bad. Every trait has its possible benefits and potential downsides—it's all in how you use it.

### Your Top 3 Personality Superpowers
Which of your personality traits are your biggest assets? We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and many psychologists believe that the key to success is not in trying to overcome all your flaws, but rather in making the most of what you have going for you. Let's look now at some traits that you may be able to deploy to your benefit.

As you read over this section, remember that even beneficial personality traits can work against you if they are overused. For each superpower below, you'll see how it can benefit your life, as well as how it may backfire if not kept in balance.

### PERFECTIONISM
You work hard—very hard—to make sure every detail is correct. Those who work with you know they can count on you to produce consistent, quality work, with every detail in place. Although extreme perfectionism can work against productivity, making it hard to complete any project for fear it isn't absolutely perfect, your commitment to getting things right can be one of your greatest assets when used judiciously.
